My name is Ryan, I am a Machine Learning and AI fanatic.

My tech stack is mostly Python, but I am versed in C# and Kotlin. My favorite tools are libraries like Sklearn, Numpy and Pandas.

I'm always looking for new ways to improve, so I usually take up projects whenever I can.

You can reach me through my LinkedIn, which I have listed on my profile.
