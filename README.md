My name is Ryan, and I am an AI coder 😄.

My tech stack is mainly Python, but I am also versed in C# and Kotlin (although not as well as Python). My favorite tools are libraries like Sklearn, PyTorch and MatPlotLib.

I'm always looking for new ways to improve, so I usually take up projects whenever I can.

You can reach me through my LinkedIn, which I have listed on my profile.
