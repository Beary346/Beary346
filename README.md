My name is Ryan, and I am an AI coder.

The language I use mainly is Python. My favorite tools are libraries like Sklearn, PyTorch and MatPlotLib.

I'm always looking for new ways to learn and improve, so I usually take up projects whenever I can.

You can reach me through my LinkedIn, which I have listed on my profile.
